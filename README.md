# CIFAR-10 Object Detection Repository

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Object Detection Repository! This repository contains code and resources for training and evaluating object detection models on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of this project is to develop and test CNN-based models capable of accurately detecting objects within these images.

## Introduction

Identifying and localizing objects within an image is a fundamental computer vision task known as object detection. The widely used CIFAR-10 dataset serves as a benchmark for image classification tasks, but this repository ups the ante for object detection with CNN-based models. The CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset can be trained and tested using the code found in the CNN_object_prediction-Cifar10.ipynb Jupyter Notebook that is provided.

### Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.x) or PyTorch (>= 1.6)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Usage

### Training

To train the CNN object detection model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, open the [`CNN_object_detection-Cifar10.ipynb`](CNN_object_detection-Cifar10.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook and run the training code segment. Make sure to specify the desired number of epochs (e.g., 100 epochs) during training.

### Evaluation

After training the CNN model, you can evaluate its performance on the test set using the same Jupyter Notebook. The evaluation code segment will compute the accuracy for the trained model.

## Models

The current implementation includes a CNN-based object detection model. However, feel free to explore and add more models to the repository to improve detection performance!

## Results

The results of the CNN model's performance are available in the Jupyter Notebook `CNN_object_prediction-Cifar10.ipynb`. The notebook will display the achieved accuracy and other evaluation metrics after training the model for 100 epochs.

## Potential Improvement - Data Augmentation

To further improve the generalization and robustness of the object detection model, consider incorporating data augmentation techniques. To increase the diversity of the training set, data augmentation involves applying various transformations to the training data, such as rotations, flips, translations, and brightness adjustments. The model's performance on unobserved data can be improved by this augmentation, which can help it handle various object orientations, lighting situations, and viewpoints better.

Although data augmentation has not been used in the repository's current iteration, it offers a promising path for future development. Implementing data augmentation methods, like those offered by PyTorch's torchvision.transforms or TensorFlow's torchvision.generator, can be a beneficial addition to the training pipeline.

## Contributing
